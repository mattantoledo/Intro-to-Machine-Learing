Practical assignments of Introduction to Machine Learning course at TAU


### hw1 - k-Nearest Neighbours on MNIST dataset
- Fetch the MNIST dataset that contains 28x28 images of handwritten digits with their labels
- Implement the k-NN algorithm using different k and different size of training set
- Compare the results to find the best k


### hw2 - Kernel SVM
- Create data set of 2D points classified by a circle.
- Explore the SVM model with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) and compare different parameters (coef0, gamma)
- Plot the results


### hw3 - Kernel SVM
- Create data set of 2D points classified by a circle.
- Explore the SVM model with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) and compare different parameters (coef0, gamma)
- Plot the results

### hw4 - Kernel SVM
- Create data set of 2D points classified by a circle.
- Explore the SVM model with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) and compare different parameters (coef0, gamma)
- Plot the results
