# Intro-to-Machine-Learning
Practical assignments of Introduction to Machine Learning course at TAU


### hw1 - k-Nearest Neighbours on MNIST dataset
- Fetch the MNIST dataset that contains 28x28 images of handwritten digits with their labels
- Implement the k-NN algorithm using different k and different sizes of the training set
- Compare the results to find the best k


### hw2 - Union of Intervals - ERM
- Create data set of 1D points in (0,1)
- Binary classification (+1, -1) based on k disjoint intervals
- Calculate empirical error and true error (distribution is given)
- Find the best k
- Holdout-Validation method


### hw3 - SGD (hinge loss vs. log loss) on MNIST dataset
- Implement SGD functions with appropriate gradient updates (hinge loss and log loss)
- Cross-validate to find best step size for SGD
- Calculate the accuracy of the classifiers

### hw4 - Kernel SVM
- Create data set of 2D points classified by a circle.
- Explore the SVM model with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) and compare different parameters (coef0, gamma)
- Add some noise to the labels and see how the models behave
